# Calendar Project!!

In my this calendar you can type a date that you have in mind and it will show all the days in that month

## Future Updates

- The user date should be highlighter (the background color of that day should be different)

- If the use click on any Date a To-Do page will appear
  - The To-Do page will use the date as a header
  - Will ask for his town
    - if the user give his location use the weather API to display his temperature and give him 3 recommendation of things to do with his current weather

### Bugs

So far the website have 2 bugs

- Date are in the wrong location
  - For example => the day location of 08/02/2024 aren't the same as 08/03/2024
- The name of the month will be wrong if we type the first date of any month
  - For example -> 08/01/2024 the name of the month will be July

### Possible solutions

- Maybe if I use only one function to display the weekDays and the date the first bug will be fix

- For the second bug I not sure what the cause will be, I will have to modified my code so the header match it in base of the user input and not rely on the function
